## My process

### Built with

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Something that I learned when doing this challenge was that images, being inline elements, have properties that affect the texts, which causes a blank space to be added below them. To avoid this problem, you must set the property `display: block;`.
